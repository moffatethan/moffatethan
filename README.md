## I'm Ethan! :wave:

🎊 Hello world!

I have been teaching myself programming for about 7 years now. I am passionate on building projects with great design, good user experience, and apps that give me a challenge to do better.

- :hammer_and_pick: JavaScript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, MongoDB, Postgres, Elixir, TailwindCSS, UI/UX
- :package: Currently building a budgeting app
- :book: Currently reading Django for Beginners by William S. Vincent
- 🇯🇵 Currently learning Japanese, been to Japan once! こにちわ、わたしのなまえいーすん。よろしくおねがいします!
- ⚡ Fun fact! How I started programming was I went to a website and saw a cool animation and just Googled how to do that and years later... I am still Googling.
